    /// - Remark: Though `httpMethod` appears to be `Optional`. In practice it never returns a
    /// `.none`. Even if the property remains unset it returns `"get"`. This was creating an
    /// corner-case I could not test for. Therefore, to increase code-coverage I've refactored
    /// `Track.Request.Method` initializer to accept an `String?` and could then test the
    /// corner-case there.
